1)	Find the people who would likely to make the investment.
```{r}
investment = adult[which(complete.cases(adult)==TRUE),]
investment$investor= 0
investment$investor = ifelse(investment$capitalgain == 0 & investment$capitalloss == 0, 0, 1)
head(investment)
investment$investor = as.factor(investment$investor)

```

```{r}
table(investment$investor)

```

```{r}

mylogitnull = glm(investor~1, data= investment, family = binomial)
summary(mylogitnull)
```
```{r}

mylogitfull = glm(investor~age + workclass+ fnlwgt +educationnum + maritalstatus +occupation +relationship+ race +sex +hoursperweek_cat + nativecountry +income, investment, family = binomial)
summary(mylogitfull)
anova(mylogitfull, test = "LRT")
```


```{r}
#Removing fnlwgt, race and native country
mylogit1 = glm(investor~age + workclass +educationnum +maritalstatus+ occupation +relationship +sex +hoursperweek + income , investment, family = binomial, x=TRUE)
summary(mylogit1)
anova(mylogitfull, mylogit1, test = "Chisq")
anova(mylogit1, test = "Chisq")
```
p value is not <0.05, therefore models are not different.


```{r}

mylogit2 <- glm(investor ~ age + education + occupation + relationship +sex, data = investment, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit2)
```


```{r}

mylogit3 <- glm(investor ~ age +education+ relationship+sex +income, data = investment, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit3)
anova(mylogit1, mylogit3,test = "Chisq")
```

```{r}

mylogit4 <- glm(investor ~ age +education+ sex +income, data = investment, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit4)
```
